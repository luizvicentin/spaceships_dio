# Description of the Exercise

Repository of the JS class taught on the Digital Innovation One platform, whose challenge was to create a game similar to a rescue Space-Shooter.

One of the difficulties for game developers is to find a development platform compatible with the various mobile devices on the market and also with the different browsers. Using HTML5 together with CSS3 style sheets and JavaScript, it is possible to develop games in a fast and compatible way with several platforms, including mobile devices. The project discusses the development stages of games in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript from start to finish, using the didactic step by step in its development. In this project, specifically, the games will be published so that they can be accessed via browser.
